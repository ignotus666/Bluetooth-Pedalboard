Ver 0.81:

Added ResponsiveAnalogRead library for the hall sensor expression pedal. When on battery power the output was very jittery; 
this library fixes the issue entirely. AnalogSmooth is good for the battery readings (lots of readings over a longer timespan)
but not so good for returning values quickly. Likewise, ResponsiveAnalogRead isn't good for averaging readings over longer
periods.
